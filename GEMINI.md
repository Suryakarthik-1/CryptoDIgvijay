# Development Conventions

*   The project follows a standard React component-based architecture.
*   Components are organized into folders based on their functionality (e.g., `about`, `blog`, `contact`).
*   The `src/router/index.jsx` file defines all the application routes.
*   Styling is a mix of Bootstrap, custom CSS files, and CSS-in-JS for some components.
*   The project uses ES modules (`import`/`export`).
